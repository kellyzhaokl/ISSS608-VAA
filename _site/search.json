The dense overlapping of lines creates visual clutter, making it hard to distinguish between different groups or to identify trends within individual groups.\n\n\n\nAlignment and Layout: Aligning the plots in a horizontal array allows for an easy comparison across the different subjects. This layout is effective for side-by-side analysis without needing to scroll or switch between different visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Final Design\nAfter performing necessary modifications, the final code and design are as follows:\n\n\nCode\nstu_qqq_SG &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Math = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(\"PV1MATH\"), ends_with(\"PV10MATH\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Reading = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(\"PV1READ\"), ends_with(\"PV10READ\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Science = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(\"PV1SCIE\"), ends_with(\"PV10SCIE\")), na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nnew_data &lt;- select(stu_qqq_SG,CNTSTUID,CNTSCHID,ST004D01T, ESCS, Math, Reading, Science)\n\n# Calculate the average scores for each school and subject\nschool_averages &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNTSCHID) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Math = mean(Math, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Reading = mean(Reading, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Science = mean(Science, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n# Reshape the data to a long format for plotting\nschool_averages_long &lt;- school_averages %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Math, Reading, Science),\n    names_to = \"Subject\",\n    values_to = \"Average_Score\"\n  )\n\n# Select the top 2 and bottom 2 schools for each subject\ntop_schools &lt;- school_averages_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(Subject) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(order_by = Average_Score, n = 2) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nbottom_schools &lt;- school_averages_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(Subject) %&gt;%\n  slice_min(order_by = Average_Score, n = 2) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Create the scatter plot\np &lt;- ggplot(school_averages_long, aes(x = Subject, y = Average_Score)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = CNTSCHID), position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.6)) +\n  labs(title = \"Relationship between Performances with Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add labels for the top 2 and bottom 2 schools\np + geom_label_repel(\n      data = top_schools, \n      aes(label = CNTSCHID), \n      nudge_y = 6, # Adjust this value based on your plot's scale\n      direction = \"y\",\n      color = \"blue\",\n      size = 3,\n      segment.size = 0.2,\n      segment.color = \"blue\") +\n    geom_label_repel(\n      data = bottom_schools, \n      aes(label = CNTSCHID), \n      nudge_y = -8, # Adjust this value based on your plot's scale\n      direction = \"y\",\n      color = \"red\",\n      size = 3,\n      segment.size = 0.2,\n      segment.color = \"red\") +\n    theme(legend.position = \"right\") # Remove legend for cleaner plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarityAesthetics\n\n\n\nClean Layout: The plot has a clean and uncluttered layout with a minimalist design that keeps the focus on the data. The background is free of unnecessary elements, which minimizes distractions and allows for the data and labels to stand out clearly.\nTop2 And Bottom 2 Contrast: The use of contrasting colors (red for the bottom schools and blue for the top schools) is aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective. It immediately draws attention to the performance extremes without overwhelming the viewer with too much color differentiation.\n\n\n\nBalanced Color Usage: The restrained use of color for labeling purposes ensures that the plot is not visually overwhelming, maintaining a balance that is pleasing to the eye and enhances readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Relationship between Performances with Gender\n\n2.3.1 Original Version\n\n\nClarityAesthetics\n\n\nDensity Plots: Using density plots provides a quite clear display about the distribution of the data.\n\n\nColor Harmony: The choice of different colors creates a visually harmonious color scheme that complements the overall design.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Final Design\nAfter performing necessary modifications, the final code and design are as follows:\n\n\nCode\nstu_qqq_SG_final &lt;- stu_qqq_SG %&gt;%\n  mutate(GENDER = recode(ST004D01T,\n                         `1` = \"Female\",\n                         `2` = \"Male\"))\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG_final, \n       aes(x = meanmathscore,\n           color=GENDER,\n           fill=GENDER)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 0.08, alpha=0.8,color=\"gray\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#00FFFF\", \"#FFFF99\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 900)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG_final, \n       aes(x = meanreadscore,\n           color=GENDER,\n           fill=GENDER)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 0.08, alpha=0.8,color=\"gray\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#00FFFF\", \"#FFFF99\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 900)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=stu_qqq_SG_final, \n       aes(x = meansciescore,\n           color=GENDER,\n           fill=GENDER)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 0.08, alpha=0.8,color=\"gray\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#00FFFF\", \"#FFFF99\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 900)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 8), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n(p1/p2/p3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarityAesthetics\n\n\n\nCombining female and male scores on the same plot allows for direct comparison between genders, making it easier to observe differences and similarities in score distributions.\nThe use of different colors for each gender (blue for female and yellow for male) helps in quickly distinguishing between the two groups.\n\n\n\n1.The color scheme is pleasant, with soft shades that make the graph visually appealing and easy to look at for longer periods without causing strain.\n2.The layout is clean and uncluttered, with a clear demarcation between the different plots, which improves readability and overall visual appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Original Relationship between Performances with Socio Economic Status\n\n2.4.1 Original Version\n\n\nClarityAesthetics\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of a line of best fit on each plot provides a clear visual indication of the trend or relationship between socioeconomic status and the mean scores for each subject, which helps in interpreting the data.\nThe current continuous scatter could obscure subtle changes in score distributions within specific socioeconomic strata, which binning could help to highlight.\n\n\n\nColor Harmony: The choice of different colors creates a visually harmonious color scheme that complements the overall design.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Final Design\nAfter performing necessary modifications, the final code and design are as follows:\n\n\nCode\n# Filter out rows with NA values in ESCS\nnew_data &lt;- new_data[!is.na(new_data$ESCS),]\n\nlong_data &lt;- pivot_longer(new_data, \n                          cols = c(\"Math\", \"Reading\", \"Science\"),\n                          names_to = \"subject\", \n                          values_to = \"score\")\n# Convert ESCS column to numeric\nlong_data$ESCS &lt;- as.numeric(long_data$ESCS)\n\n# Define breaks and labels\nbreaks &lt;- c(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4)\nlabels &lt;- c(\"Low\", \"Low Medium\", \"Medium\", \"Top\")\n\n# Use cut with the numeric ESCS column\nbins &lt;- cut(long_data$ESCS, breaks = breaks, labels = labels, include.lowest = TRUE)\n\nlong_data &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(ESCS = bins)\n\nggplot(long_data, \n       aes(y = score, x = ESCS, fill = ESCS)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +  #

This step of classification allows for a cleaner and more organized presentation, making it easier for the audience to digest the information.\nFurthermore, I’ve realized that the impact of a visualization is often in the details. The same chart can be transformed from a simple illustration to a compelling narrative with the strategic use of colors, adjusted titles, and the inclusion of helpful annotations like auxiliary lines. These seemingly minor tweaks can significantly enhance the visualization’s ability to engage and inform."

    "text": "For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\ntidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, and\nggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.\n\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,                colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\n\n\nCode\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"D:/kellyzhaokl/ISSS608-VAA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex02/data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualization technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nThe figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp. [F]\",\n                       option = \"C\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF0000A0\", \"#A0A0A0A0\", \"#0000FFA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.025]\", \"(0.025, 0.975]\", \"(0.975, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualization technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nThe figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp. [F]\",\n                       option = \"C\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF0000A0\", \"#A0A0A0A0\", \"#0000FFA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.025]\", \"(0.025, 0.975]\", \"(0.975, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()"

It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n1.5How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

Exercises\n\n2.1 Using ggiraph for interactive data visualization\nggiraph package\n\nInteractive Arguments of ggiraph\n\nTooltip: displayed when hovering over chart elements\nOnclick: executed when elements are clicked\nData_id: Uses columns as id to show asan sociation of elements\n\n\nIf it is used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.\n\n2.1.1 Using tooltip (tooltip effect)\nThere are two parts of the codes: 1. creating ggplot object, 2. girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\nCode\n#Creating new field called tooltip\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,\n  \"\\n Class\", exam_data$CLASS\n))\n\nmy_plot2 &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  \n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip),         #refer to the tooltip field above\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot2,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Customising tooltip style\nUsing opts_tooltip to customise tooltip rendering by adding css declaration\n\n\nCode\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; font-style:bold; color:red;\"\n\nmy_plot3 &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  \n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot3,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_tooltip(\n      css = tooltip_css)\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Background color is now white and the font color is red and bold\n\n\n2.1.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nIn this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip. This is created by creating a function\n\n\nCode\ntooltip_fn &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   \n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) \n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) \n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)                      \n} \n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = RACE)) +\n  \n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = MATHS, \n        tooltip = after_stat(\n          tooltip_fn(y, ymax))),\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,\n    fill = \"lightblue\"\n    ) +\n  \n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, linewidth = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = gg_point,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Using data_id (hover effect)\n\n\nCode\nmy_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = CLASS),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. Note that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n2.1.6 Customising hover effect style\nUsing css declaration to change the highlighting effect\n\n\nCode\nmy_plot2 &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = CLASS),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot2,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: pink;\"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. Notice opts_hover refers to the selected data and opts_hover_inv refers to the non-selected data. Different from section 2.1.3 above, the css customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n2.1.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect\n\n\nCode\nmy_plot_comb &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = CLASS,\n        data_id = CLASS),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot_comb,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_tooltip(css = \"background-color:white; font-style:bold; color:green;\"),\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: pink;\"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over. At the same time, the tooltip will show the CLASS.\n\n\n2.1.8 Using onclick (click effect)\nonclick argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.\n\n\nCode\nexam_data$onclick &lt;- sprintf(\"window.open(\\\"%s%s\\\")\",\n\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school\",\nas.character(exam_data$ID))\n\nmy_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(onclick = onclick),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = my_plot,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Web document link with a data object will be displayed on the web browser upon mouse click. Note that click actions must be a string column in the dataset containing valid javascript instructions.\n\n\n2.1.9 Coordinated multiple views with ggiraph\nCoordinated multiple views methods is interactive in which when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.\nIn order to build a coordinated multiple views, the following programming strategy will be used:\n\nAppropriate interactive functions of ggiraph will be used to create the multiple views.\npatchwork function of patchwork package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = MATHS)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID,\n        data_id = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = exam_data,\n            aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID,\n        data_id = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  code = print(p1 / p2),\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: blue;\"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")    \n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data_id aesthetic is critical to link observations between plots and the tooltip aesthetic is optional but nice to have when mouse over a point.\n\n\n\n2.2 Using plotly method for interactive data visualization\n\nPlotly’s R graphing library create interactive web graphics from ggplot2 graphs and/or a custom interface to the (MIT-licensed) JavaScript library plotly.js inspired by the grammar of graphics.\nDifferent from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n2.2.1 Using plot_ly\nCreating basic interactive scatterplot\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data,\n        x = ~MATHS,\n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the default color pallete to ColorBrewel colour palette\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH, \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising the color scheme manually\n\n\nCode\npal &lt;- c(\"red\", \"purple\", \"blue\", \"green\")\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH, \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = pal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising tooltip\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        text = ~paste(\"Student ID:\", ID,     \n                      \"&lt;br&gt;Class:\", CLASS),  \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with layout. To learn more about layout, visit this link.\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~MATHS, \n        y = ~ENGLISH,\n        text = ~paste(\"Student ID:\", ID,     \n                      \"&lt;br&gt;Class:\", CLASS),  \n        color = ~RACE, \n        colors = \"Set1\") |&gt; \n  \n  layout(title = 'English Score versus Maths Score',\n         xaxis = list(range = c(0,100)),\n         yaxis = list(range = c(0,100)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Using ggplotly\nCreating basic interactive scatterplot. With ggplotly, we can use the original ggplot2 and add ggplotly at the end as extra line\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(dotsize = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Multiple Views using highlight_key and subplot of plotly package\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n              aes(x = MATHS,\n                  y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\n2.3 Using crosstalk method for interactive data visualization\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n2.3.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nCode\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Linked brushing using crosstalk method\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n              aes(x = MATHS,\n                  y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),\n                \"plotly_selected\")\n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,\n                  DT::datatable(d),\n                  widths = 5)     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Using gganimate method for creating animation\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\nImport data from the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook.\n\n\nCode\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\nBasic ggplot function to create static bubble plot\n\n\nCode\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  \n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  \n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding animated bubble plot\n\n\nCode\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  \n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  \n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  \n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method\ncreate an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\n\nCode\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot. The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot. To overcome this problem, theme(legend.position='none') should be used as shown in the plot and code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\n\nCode\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp"

Boys often do better in Math and Science.\nSchool 003 leads with top scores in Math and Science, which may reflect its excellent programs in these fields. School 062 shines in Reading, hinting at a strong focus on literacy. Meanwhile, school 149 lags in all subjects, which could signal various difficulties at the school.\nHigher socioeconomic status is linked to better grades for students."
